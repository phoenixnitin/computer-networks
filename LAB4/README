I used port no. 4567 for testing myself.
ports such as 4568, 2356,etc could also be used.

files could be compiled from the LAB4 directory.
$ make
make will compile all the files

If server and client is not provided port number, then default port is 4567.
If client is not provided hostname , then default localhost is used.

It has been assumed that user spool file does not contain more than 1000 emails.

Server could be executed in following ways:
$ ./EMAILserver
or
$ ./EMAILserver 4567

Client could be executed in following ways:
$ ./EMAILclient
or
$ ./EMAILclient 4567
or 
$ ./EMAILclient localhost 4567

After reading the all the messages the pointer has been made to go back to first mail by showing a output "INVALID: No More Mail"
If user sends mail to himself then, to refresh read pointer, user has to give first "done" command , and then "setuser <user>" (i.e user has to login again to refresh mails)


for connecting to server using server name (instead of ip address), hosts file has to be updated in server as well as client running machine, with server ipaddress and name.
Open this file
$ sudo gedit /etc/hosts
and add a entry 
10.22.16.178	nitinserver
